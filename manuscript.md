Abstract
----------------
The paper explores the effect of a gap year on young people's outlook for the future (life satisfaction and satisfaction with career and future prospects) and actual teriary educational outcomes (university dropout, course change, degree attainment) in a representative sample of $N = 2883$ Australian Youth (Direct university entrants: $N = 2248$; Gap Year: $N = 635$) over one pre and 5 post high-school transition time waves. Results suggest that after the application of propensity score matching direct university entrants on 700 covariates (including their interactions and quadratic terms) young peoples outlook for the future was largely unaffected by post high-school pathway with both groups experiencing an initial rise in satisfaction before considerable declines as they entered their 20's. Suprisingly, after matching actual teriary outcomes were more negative for gap-year youth. These findings have important implications for educational policy which is moving toward great support for gap-year options.

Introduction
-------------------
Gap Years have dramatically increase in popularity such that some universities are now offering financial insentives to students to undertake them (). Research in this area, however, is generally hampered by retrospective designs with no or limitied  matching of participants who undertake or do not undertake a gap-year. As such, while the majority of avaliable research suggests an extended number of benefits,
